                            <strong>Tesla</strong>'s mission since its inception in 2003 has been to provide mass-market
                            <strong>electric cars (EVs)</strong>with a compelling customer value proposition. This
                            comprises a long-range car with recharging flexibility, as well as an energy-efficient,
                            low-cost, and high-performing vehicle that does not sacrifice design or functionality. This
                            webpage explains Tesla's one-of-a-kind marketing strategy in China.

                            The design, production, and sale of fully electric vehicles are all part of Tesla's
                            automotive business. Tesla's <strong>Model S, Model X, and Model Y</strong> premium sedans
                            and SUVs target the premium car and SUV segments, while the <strong>Model 3 targets the
                                mainstream vehicle market</strong>. Design, production, and sale of solar energy
                            generation systems and energy storage solutions to industrial and commercial customers make
                            up the energy generation and storage category. The company benefits from key expertise in
                            powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing, and energy storage,
                            among other things.

                                Tesla's worldwide domination
                            </h4>
                            Tesla has been leading the charge towards alternative energy in the passenger vehicle sector
                            since going public in 2010. Tesla is currently regarded as a forward-thinking, exciting, and
                            dominant player in the global vehicle business. Tesla's market worth hit <strong>$774
                                billion in 2021</strong>, making it the seventh most valuable firm in the United States.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Tesla's vehicle deliveries worldwide hit over <strong>500,000 units in 2020, up 36% from
                                2019</strong>. Tesla's Model 3 is now the <strong>best-selling</strong> plug-in electric
                            vehicle in the world. Model 3 car deliveries accounted for <strong>over 80%</strong> of
                            total sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2019, duplicating the Model S and Model X
                            products, which were originally geared at clients in the high-end sector of the market. With
                            the Model 3, Tesla is now targeting a larger range of customers.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As we can see from the data below, Tesla has unquestionably dominated the electric vehicle
                            industry, selling about <strong>140,000</strong> more vehicles than BYD, which came in
                            second. This not only demonstrates Tesla's dominance in the electric vehicle market, but
                            also the growing <strong>acceptability</strong> of electric vehicles by the general public.

                            </h4>
                            The Chinese government's efforts to attract an influential international firm, in order to
                            boost its image of <strong>market openness</strong>, were exemplified by Tesla's arrival
                            into the country. China expects that Tesla will become an industry leader, promoting the
                            <strong>localization</strong> of EV design and manufacture inside China's industrial and
                            supply chain, with the ultimate goal of propelling China's EV industry to new heights.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Tesla's decision to invest in China was a watershed moment for the firm. Tesla made history
                            by becoming the <strong>first foreign automaker to be granted full autonomy</strong> in
                            China while maintaining 100 percent ownership. Tesla no longer has to worry about
                            <strong>"forced technology (IP) transfers"</strong> of its patents, thanks to a recent
                            amendment to China's Foreign Investment Law. Automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Ford,
                            Toyota, and other foreign carmakers have been pursuing this arrangement for years.

                            </h4>
                            Tesla After completing its <strong>Gigafactory</strong> in Shanghai in late 2019, China grew
                            greatly in 2020 and beyond as a result of having local production capabilities. This is
                            advantageous to the business for two reasons. <strong>First</strong>, because Tesla can
                            avoid import duties on finished automobiles by manufacturing in China, and
                            <strong>second</strong>, because its locally produced cars are eligible for
                            <strong>government subsidies</strong>. China has been the ideal location for Tesla because
                            it is a major supplier of automotive parts to the worldwide industry as well as a hub for
                            electric mobility and smart grids.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            From the data we can see apart from the environmental factor which is an inherent attribute
                            of electric vehicles. <strong>Government subsidies</strong> and the price of energy are the
                            main factors determining people's purchase of electric vehicles.

                            Tesla's business model differs from that of other traditional automakers in that it controls
                            the <strong>whole supply chain</strong>, from manufacturing to distribution. The ultimate
                            goal of this strategy is to reduce manufacturing costs and the cost of goods supplied,
                            ensuring the company's <strong>long-term viability</strong>. Unlike prior versions, the
                            Model X and Model 3 are aimed at the mass market for electric automobiles. Tesla's supply
                            chain management strategy prioritizes long-term growth through production, inventory
                            management, and distribution.

                            </h4>
                            Tesla's business model encompasses every facet of retail and distribution. It <strong>owns
                                all of its dealers and sales facilities</strong>, as well as handling vehicle repair and
                            maintenance internally.

                            Traditional OEMs, on the other hand, rely on a multi-tiered sales network that includes both
                            single-brand and multi-brand dealers. Tesla, in defiance of this entrenched structure, chose
                            to promote its vehicles via the <strong>Internet</strong>. Making use of the so-called
                            direct sales system. Tesla's direct sales model differs significantly from that of
                            traditional franchised dealerships. In this way, the corporation not only owns the channel
                            touch-points and data, but also the customer experience, which might lead to potential
                            advantages for future product development.

                            </h4>
                            Some Tesla models are cheaper in China due to government subsidies for electric vehicles.
                            Tesla, for example, lowered the price of a Chinese-made Model 3 by around
                            <strong>8%</strong> in 2020. The previous price was 271,500 yuan, but it was reduced to
                            249,900 yuan. <br>
                            <br>
                            Most dealers are unsuited to <strong>online-only sales</strong>, but Tesla has done so
                            successfully. The advantage of set pricing arises as a result of this sales model. This
                            implies that the vehicle's retail pricing <strong>remains the same</strong> regardless of
                            where you purchase it within the Tesla network. When you've gotten to the stage where you
                            can price an EV at a fixed price, you can think about selling it online. This sets Tesla
                            apart from the competition since other automakers would have to at least get to the stage
                            where customers believe they are getting value from the brand. This pricing and distribution
                            approach gives them the look and feel of an Apple product.

                            </h4>
                            Tesla's marketing strategy in China is unconventional. In truth, there isn't a marketing
                            department at the corporation. Tesla's cutting-edge marketing strategy, according to Elon
                            Musk, is <strong>"$0 Marketing Budget."</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite the lack of a budget, there are few aspects that distinguish Tesla's Chinese
                            marketing strategy. First and foremost, Tesla strives to give the <strong>finest customer
                                service possible</strong>. The website has all of the information regarding cars, and
                            the entire car-buying procedure may be completed online. <strong>During COVID-19</strong>,
                            this is extremely critical.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Tesla's Chinese marketing strategy also includes a <strong>referral program</strong>, rather
                            than paid advertising. People talk about their Tesla purchases and experiences, which
                            attracts new buyers. Elon Musk's persona is unquestionably crucial to Tesla's Chinese
                            marketing strategy. He has been one of the leading newsmakers in recent years and is active
                            on social media.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Finally, in China, Tesla places a <strong>premium on transparency</strong>. Consumers' faith
                            in a brand is increased when company representatives discuss what occurs if an issue arises.

                            </h4>
                            Tesla's success was largely dependent on <strong>timing and vision</strong>. In the
                            mid-2000s, Tesla was one of only a few pure EV car manufacturers in the world, and it was
                            likely the first to produce a reliable EV drivetrain and battery pack. The company was one
                            of the first to anticipate that <strong>lithium-ion battery</strong> prices will continue to
                            fall for many years. Tesla's hard charging nature, driven by CEO Elon Musk, as well as its
                            distinct branding approach, helped it stand out from the competition and win devoted fans.
                            Furthermore, Tesla's commercial and operational models are designed to address the major
                            issues that Chinese EV buyers face.

                            Electric Car Co. are among the electric vehicle manufacturers already operating in China. A
                            set of electric car start-ups, including Byton and WM Motor Tech, is also on the rise in

                            Despite its dominance in electric vehicle sales in the United States, Tesla is
                            <strong>trailing</strong> local competitors in China's large and lucrative market. According
                            to Clean Technica's newest survey of plug-in electric vehicle sales in China, the BAIC
                            EU-Series was the most popular model between January and August of this year. The electric
                            sedan outsold two other Chinese models,the Tesla Model 3 fell far behind, In 2020. However,
                            the market has changed, Model 3 become the <strong>most selling electric sedan in
                                2020</strong>.
